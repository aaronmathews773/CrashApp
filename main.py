title = 'CrashApp: Travel Better'

mission = '''Transportation is vital to humanity. We go places to get food, learn, explore, and even for the fun of it.
Naturally, we try to do this in the best way possible. For General Motors, this means zero crashes, zero emissions,
and zero congestions. Our project attempts to give GM an easy dashboard where they can access data on crash, emission, and traffic data, because knowledge is power.'''
